    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Schnitzel is a traditional dish made by breading and frying thinly pounded meat, typically chicken or pork. It's crispy, golden, and perfect when served with a squeeze of lemon and a side of potatoes or salad. Sides with schnitzel varies from cluture to cluture.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb. skinless boneless chicken breast</li>
        <li>¾ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon turmeric</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Trim chicken breast to remove all tendon, cartilage and fat. Now you can either slice chicken breast into thin slices and get a few small schnitzels, or butterfly the chicken breast by slicing the breast staring from the long side until you almost slice all the way through, then open the chicken breast like a book to a double-sized schnitzel.</li>
        <li>Now you can choose to flatten the pieces with a meat tenderizer (you don’t have to.) If you do, put each piece between two parchment papers and very gently pound it with a meat tenderizer or a rolling pin (or anything heavy, really) until schnitzel is evenly thin. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Prepare three medium bowls and a tray to hold the prepared schnitzels.</li>
        <li>Put flour and spices in the first bowl and mix in ¾ teaspoon salt. Mix it all together. In the second bowl put two eggs and beat them lightly with the water and ½ teaspoon salt. Put cornflakes crumbs in the third bowl.</li>
